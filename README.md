## General Information

This project was created to demonstrate the application of principles of accessible and responsive web page design using HTML and CSS. These principles ensure that sites can be used by users with diverse or accessibility requirements and those who rely on adaptive technologies. Whilst responsive design ensures that sites can provide an effective User Experience across different technologies.

## Description

The goal of this project is to create a responsive and visually appealing personal portfolio website that showcases the developer's skills and projects. The website consists of several sections, including a home page, an about section, a skills section, a projects section, and a contact form.

The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML and CSS files are organized using the BEM methodology and are structured in a way that is easy to read and maintain. The website is also responsive and adapts to different screen sizes using CSS media queries.

The website uses several CSS techniques to create a visually appealing design, including custom fonts, colors, and animations. The website also uses JavaScript to add interactivity to the contact form and to create a smooth scrolling effect.
